Components Used
1. Arduino Mega 2560

The main microcontroller responsible for coordinating all system operations, including data communication, actuator control, and program logic execution.

2. RTC DS1307

A Real-Time Clock module used to maintain accurate time data (hours, minutes, date) even when the system is powered off, supported by a backup battery.

3. EEPROM 24LC256

A 256-Kbit external non-volatile memory module used to store NFC card IDs and various system configuration data.

4. FTDI Basic Programmer / FT232

A USB-to-Serial converter used for communication between the Arduino and a computer at 9600 baud. It is also utilized for firmware programming and debugging.

5. TP4056 Lithium Battery Charger

A charging module for 3.7V Li-ion / LiPo batteries, providing regulated charging current and overcharge protection.

6. 3.7V Li-ion Battery (BAT1)

Serves as the primary power source for standalone system operation without USB power.

7. Switch Button

Used as a user interface to switch between operation modes, such as NFC-based verification mode or Arduino-based verification mode.

8. OLED Display

Displays system information, status messages, notifications, and authentication results.

9. AS608 Fingerprint Sensor

A fingerprint module that supports biometric authentication, including fingerprint enrollment, verification, and template matching.

10. Boost Converter (MC34063A)

A DC-DC step-up converter used to increase the 3.7V battery voltage to 5V.
This converter circuit includes:

L1 Inductor (330 µH)

1N5819 Schottky Diode

Feedback Resistors (R3, R4, R6, R7)

Capacitors (C3, C4, C6, C7)

Ensures a stable 5V supply for the Arduino.

11. Power Standby Module

A custom-designed module to reduce standby power consumption and enhance security by preventing unauthorized access to the Arduino. The module includes:

Relay (electronic power switch)

1N4007 Diode (reverse-voltage protection)

Push Button (activation trigger)

Capacitors (voltage stabilization)

Resistors (current limiting)

LED Indicator (power status display)
