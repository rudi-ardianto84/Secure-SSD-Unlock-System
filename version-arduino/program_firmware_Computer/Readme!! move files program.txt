Readme!! move files program 

This project is designed to run entirely through a portable Python installation located directly on the SSD NVMe that will be encrypted. Instead of copying a pre-packaged Python folder, users must install a portable version of Python—such as WinPython or another standalone distribution—directly onto the root of the target drive. The portable Python directory should not be placed inside additional subfolders, as the system needs to load the interpreter from the top-level directory of the disk. After installing the portable Python environment, open its built-in terminal and install all required modules into this portable setup using the following command: pip install pyserial cryptography rarfile pycryptodome pyperclip. These dependencies are installed only within the portable environment, making the system fully self-contained and independent from any Python installation on the host machine.

Once the portable interpreter and its modules are prepared, create a VeraCrypt encrypted container according to your required size and place the resulting container file inside the bin directory on the same drive. The program automatically searches for the container in this location, and placing it elsewhere will prevent detection. With both the portable Python environment and the encrypted container in position, the system can be launched by running start.exe. This executable initializes the portable Python interpreter, establishes communication with the Arduino, performs fingerprint or NFC authentication, and then decrypts and mounts the VeraCrypt container. Through this mechanism, the entire system operates securely and in a plug-and-play manner across different computers without requiring any installation or system modifications.
